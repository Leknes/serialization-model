# Json Serializer
Integrates the newtonsoft json library into my serialization framework. It includes the classes `JsonSerializer` and `JsonDeserializer` which derive from the corresponding classes of the serialization framework. There are also generic equivalents of all classes and interfaces in this library, that can only serialize or deserialize the specified type.
