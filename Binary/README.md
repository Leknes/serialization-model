# Binary Serializer
This library provides various classes like the `BinarySerializer` or the `AsyncBinaryDeserializer`.
These classes are based on the `MemoryPack` binary serializer by Cysharp and wrap them into my serialization framework.
This way these serializers can be easily be abstracted or interchanged with other object serializers.
